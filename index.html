            The Maasai (/ˈmɑːsaɪ, mɑːˈsaɪ/;[3][4] Swahili: Wamasai) are a Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting northern, central and southern Kenya and northern Tanzania.
            They are among the best-known local populations internationally due to their residence near the many game parks of the African Great Lakes and their distinctive customs and dress.
            The Maasai speak the Maa language (ɔl Maa).

                The monotheistic Maasai worship a single deity called Enkai.
                There are also two pillars or totems of Maasai society:
                Oodo Mongi, the Red Cow and Orok Kiteng, the Black Cow with a subdivision of five clans or family trees.
                
                The Maa, since the pre-colonial period have used an informal system of education for teaching the
                young about their culture.It begins from a young age.each gender has specific roles they are assigned.The men and boys are the warriors of the community,
                they take care of the cattle and the father is the head of the family and many more.the women and girls of the community take care of the household work,eg fetching firewood,cook, take care 
                 of the children and many more.
            </ol>

            <ol>
                Furthermore, they have a decentralised system of leadership.They are headed by a council of elders.They have warriors known as the illmuran,who are tasked with the job of protecting the community(olosho) 
                 and its property such as the cattle(enkishu).They also raid other communities in order to increase their territory and gain more livestock.
